# Food Menu Application Programming Interface

# About

This Project is an Application Programming Interface for a food website. This include routes for users to sign up as a vendor, create a food menu and publish the menu. Also, other users will signup and view the published menu from their part of the system and place order using javascript programming laguages (Node.js framework for server-side programming), which information is stored in database respectively.
